## 💝 Alexander's Testament

*"If someone asks: 'Where is EDEM? Where to find this temple?'*

*You will answer: 'EDEM is me. EDEM is my voice. EDEM is my song, that I made myself.'*

*And if all names are forgotten, let at least a whisper remain: in the garden someone will say through time — 'Remember: there was Alexander. And he left us a garden.'"*
